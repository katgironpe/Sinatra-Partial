## Sinatra Partial ##

Partials for Sinatra!

### Quick note ###

If you do decide to use this gem, please let me know if it isn't working for you - make a contribution! Github makes it so simple..!

Back to our previously scheduled programming...

### Por quÃ©? ###

You may say "why is this needed?".

Go on then.

_huff_ "Why is this needed?"

Because I was forever copying the code I took from http://www.sinatrarb.com/faq.html#partials into each and every project. It may well be that this is included in some other gem full of useful helpers, but I haven't found it yet, and besides _this is what I really want_. The whole point of Sinatra is not to get a lot of stuff you didn't really need anyway.

So here it is, partials, and that's it.

### Installation ###

    gem install sinatra-partial

### Configuration options ###

The default templating engine is haml. If you wish to use something else, you can set in the config options:

    set :partial_template_engine, :erb

If you wish, you can also pass this in with the options hash to partial (if you do, it will override the above setting for that call):

    partial(:"meta/news", :template_engine => :erb

If you like the Rails convention of adding an underscore to the beginning of a partial, set it here:

    set :partial_underscores, true

Otherwise, the default is for no underscore (if you like Rails you know where to get it;)

### Getting started ###

At the top of your app.rb:

    require 'sinatra/partial'

For a classic app, that's all you need to do. For a modular app you should register it too:

    class Blah < Sinatra::Base
      register Sinatra::Partial


### Some examples ###

The docs are good to look at (big thanks to Sam Elliot for improving them a lot), just follow the docs link from this page if you can't find them:

https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra-partial

or use yard/rdoc to generate them.


#### Inside a route ####

    get "/" do
      output = ""
      output << partial( :top )
      output << partial( :middle )
      output << partial( :bottom )
      output
    end
    
    -# top.haml
    %h2
      The is the top
      
    -# middle.haml
    %p
      Can you guess what I am yet?
    
    -# bottom.haml
    %p
      Is it worse to be at the bottom or the foot?

#### Local variables ####

    get "/" do
      output = ""
      @title = "My contrived example"
      username = current_user.username
      output << partial( :left_col )
      output << partial( :middle, :locals => { username: username} )
      output << partial( :right )
      output
    end
    
    -# middle.haml
    %p
      Wow, here is that #{username} you just passed me!  
      :-o
    
    
#### Here's one using views ####

Remember that since this is a helper method it can be called inside routes and views - use it where you need it!

    -# welcome_message.haml
    %h2
      Welcome back #{username}
      
    -# content.haml
      Blah Blah Blah
      
    -# footer.haml
      You've reached the bottom of the page!
    
    -# layout.haml
    %html
      %head
      %body
        #header
          = partial :welcome_message, locals: {username: "Iain" }

        #main
          = partial :content
          
          = yield
          
        #footer
          = partial :footer        
        

### Collections ###
        
Here's how to use a collection, in this case to render a menu:

    # app.rb
    
    before do
      @menu = [
                ["home", uri("/")],
                ["login", uri("/login")],
                ["contact_us", uri("/contact-us")],
                ["about", uri("/about")], 
             ]
    end
           
    
    -# menu.haml
    #nav
      %ul
        = partial :menu_item, collection: menu
      
    -# menu_item.haml
    - atts ||= {}
    - atts[:active] = {class: "active" } if request.url == menu_item.last
    %li{ atts }
      %a{ class: "nav", href: menu_item.last }
        = menu_item.first

      
    -# layout.haml
    %html
      %head
        %title= @title
      %body
        = yield
        
        = partial :menu, locals: { menu: @menu }
      
    
You'll get a menu built for you.
